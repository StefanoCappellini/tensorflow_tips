## WHAT'S THIS?
"TensorFlow tips" is, as the name says, a collection of tips. 
It is not and it will never be a book on TensorFlow nor a tutorial.
Here I will focus only on the most confusing and interesting aspects
of TensorFlow.
Each topic will be discussed in a very concise, pragmatic and
interactive way.

## WHY?
I started taking notes as a reminder for myself, but then I decided to
publish them: maybe someone will find them useful!
